it’s also possible to spawn the GUI part of your application as a
completely separate program.

This is a more advanced technique, but it can make
integration simple for some applications because of the loose coupling it implies. It can,
for instance, help with the guiStreams issues of the prior section, as long as inputs and
outputs are communicated to the GUI over Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
mechanisms, and the widget after method (or similar) is used by the GUI program to
detect incoming output to be displayed. The non-GUI script would not be blocked by
a mainloop call.

The advantage
to this approach is that it provides a separation of GUI and non-GUI code—the non-
GUI script would have to be modified only to spawn and wait for user results to appear
from the separate GUI program, but could otherwise be used as is.
