GUIs pop up quite unexpectedly.

Probably the real answer to converting a non-GUI program is to truly convert it—
restructure it to initialize widgets on startup, call mainloop once to start event processing
and display the main window, and move all program logic into callback functions triggered
by user actions. Your original program’s actions become event handlers, and your
original main flow of control becomes a program that builds a main window, calls the
GUI’s event loop once, and waits.

It’s possible, for instance, to launch GUI windows from a non-GUI main program, by
calling the tkinter mainloop each time a window must be displayed.
