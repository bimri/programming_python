"Standard Streams"
'''
The sys module is also the place where the standard input, output, and error streams
of your Python programs live; these turn out to be another common way for programs
to communicate:
'''
import sys

for f in (sys.stdin, sys.stdout, sys.stderr): 
    '''
    The standard streams are simply preopened Python file objects that are automatically
    connected to your programâ€™s standard streams when Python starts up.
    By default, all of them are tied to the console window where Python was started.
    '''
    print(f)

print(sys.stdout.write('hello stdout world' + '\n'))
print(input('hello stdin world>'))
print('hello stdin world>'); sys.stdin.readline()[:-1]
