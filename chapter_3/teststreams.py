"Redirecting Streams to Files and Programs"
'''
standard output (and print) text appears in the console window where a
program was started, standard input (and input) text comes from the keyboard, and
standard error text is used to print Python error messages to the console window.

Redirection is useful for things like canned (precoded) test inputs: we can apply a single
test script to any set of inputs by simply redirecting the standard input stream to a
different file each time the script is run.

Similarly, redirecting the standard output stream lets us save and later analyze a programâ€™s 
output; for example, testing systems might compare the saved standard output of a script with 
a file of expected output to detect failures.

Standard output can be similarly
redirected to go to a file with the > filename shell syntax. In fact, we can combine
input and output redirection in a single command:
    C:\...\PP4E\System\Streams> python teststreams.py < input.txt > output.txt
