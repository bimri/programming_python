"Capturing the stderr Stream"
# stderr can be similarly reset to files, pipes, and objects
# by setting the sys.stderr object

'''
Python itself uses standard error for error message text (and the IDLE GUI interface
intercepts it and colors it red by default). However, no higher-level tools for standard
error do what print and input do for the output and input streams. If you wish to print
to the error stream, youâ€™ll want to call sys.stderr.write() explicitly

Redirecting standard errors from a shell command line is a bit more complex and less portable.

# print(stuff, file=afile) # afile is an object, not a string name      #prints stuff to afile instead of to sys.stdout.

import sys

will send text the standard error stream object rather than sys.stdout for the duration
of this single print call only.
