"NNTP: Accessing Newsgroups"

'''
As for FTP and email tools, the script creates an NNTP object and calls its methods to
fetch newsgroup information and articlesâ€™ header and body text. The xhdr method, for
example, loads selected headers from a range of messages.

For NNTP servers that require authentication, you may also have to pass a username,
a password, and possibly a reader-mode flag to the NNTP call.

'We could turn this script into a full-blown news interface'
# to post, say this (but only if you really want to post!)
connection = NNTP(servername)
localfile = open('filename') # file has proper headers
connection.post(localfile) # send text to newsgroup
