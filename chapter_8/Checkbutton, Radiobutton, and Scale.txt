"Checkbutton, Radiobutton, and Scale"
'''
three widget types: the Checkbutton (a multiple-choice input
widget), the Radiobutton (a single-choice device), and the Scale (sometimes known as
a “slider”).
'''

'Checkbuttons'
'''
The Checkbutton and Radiobutton widgets are designed to be associated with tkinter
variables: clicking the button changes the value of the variable, and setting the variable
changes the state of the button to which it is linked.

• A collection of Checkbuttons implements a multiple-choice interface by assigning
each button a variable of its own.
• A collection of Radiobuttons imposes a mutually exclusive single-choice model by
giving each button a unique value and the same tkinter variable.
'''

Both kinds of buttons provide both command and variable options. The command option
lets you register a callback to be run immediately on button-press events, much like
normal Button widgets.
