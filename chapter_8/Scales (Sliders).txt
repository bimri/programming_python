Scales (sometimes called “sliders”) are used to select among a range of numeric values.
Moving the scale’s position with mouse drags or clicks moves the widget’s value among
a range of integers and triggers Python callbacks if registered.

Like check buttons and radio buttons, scales have both a command option for registering
an event-driven callback handler to be run right away when the scale is moved, and a
variable option for associating a tkinter variable that allows the scale’s position to be
fetched and set at arbitrary times. You can process scale settings when they are made,
or let the user pick a setting for later use.

In addition, scales have a third processing option—get and set methods that scripts
may call to access scale values directly without associating variables. Because scale
command movement callbacks also get the current scale setting value as an argument, it’s
often enough just to provide a callback for this widget, without resorting to either linked
variables or get/set method calls.
