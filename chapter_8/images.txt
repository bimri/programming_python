Supported file types
    At present, the standard tkinter PhotoImage widget supports only GIF, PPM, and
    PGM graphic file formats, and BitmapImage supports X Windows-style .xbm bitmap
    files. This may be expanded in future releases, and you can convert photos in other
    formats to these supported formats ahead of time, of course. But as we’ll see later
    in this chapter, it’s easy to support additional image types with the PIL open source
    extension toolkit and its PhotoImage replacement.

Hold on to your images!
    Unlike all other tkinter widgets, an image is utterly lost if the corresponding Python
    image object is garbage collected. That means you must retain an explicit reference
    to image objects for as long as your program needs them (e.g., assign them to a
    long-lived variable name, object attribute, or data structure component). Python
    does not automatically keep a reference to the image, even if it is linked to other
    GUI components for display. Moreover, image destructor methods erase the image
    from memory.
