So, why variables here? For one thing, radio buttons also have no “get” widget method
to fetch the selection in the future. More importantly, in radio button groups, the
value and variable settings turn out to be the whole basis of single-choice behavior.

To make radio buttons work normally at all, it’s crucial that they are all associated
with the same tkinter variable and have distinct value settings.

But it’s also true that changing a variable in any way automatically changes
every widget it is associated with. In the world of radio buttons, pressing a button sets
a shared variable, which in turn impacts other buttons associated with that variable.

This ripple effect is a bit subtle, but it might help to know that within a group of radio
buttons sharing the same variable, if you assign a set of buttons the same value, the
entire set will be selected if any one of them is pressed.
