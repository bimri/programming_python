'''
Most of the art in form layout has to do with arranging widgets in a hierarchy. This
script builds each label/entry row as a new Frame attached to the windowâ€™s current
TOP; fixed-width labels are attached to the LEFT of their row, and entries to the RIGHT.
Because each row is a distinct Frame, its contents are insulated from other packing going
on in this window. The script also arranges for just the entry fields to grow vertically
on a resize.
