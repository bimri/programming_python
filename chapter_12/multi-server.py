Same as fork-server.py, but use multiprocessing instead of os.fork;
this works on Cygwin, and probably works on other Unix-likes, because 
multiprocessing forks and descriptors are inherited, but it fails on 
Windows (sockets do not pickle correctly as arguments to the Process target), 
and would be very slow in any event (starting a new Python interpreter versus
starting an in-process thread);  I get this in 3.1 on Windows 7:

'''
multiprocessing has other IPC tools such as its own pipes and
queues that might be used instead of sockets to work around this issue, but clients
would then have to use them, tooâ€”the resulting server would not be as broadly accessible
as one based upon general Internet sockets.

Even if multiprocessing did work on Windows, though, its need to start a new Python
interpreter would likely make it much slower than the more traditional technique of
spawning threads to talk to clients.
