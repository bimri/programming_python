"A Quick Game of “Find the Biggest Python File”"
'''
Quick: what’s the biggest Python source file on your computer? This was the query
innocently posed by a student in one of my Python classes. Because I didn’t know either,
it became an official exercise in subsequent classes, and it provides a good example of
ways to apply Python system tools for a realistic purpose in this book. Really, the query
is a bit vague, because its scope is unclear. Do we mean the largest Python file in a
directory, in a full directory tree, in the standard library, on the module import search
path, or on your entire hard drive? Different scopes imply different solutions.
