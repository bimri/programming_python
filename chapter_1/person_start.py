This isnâ€™t a database yet, but we could stuff these objects into a list or dictionary as
before in order to collect them as a unit:
    >>> from person_start import Person
    >>> bob = Person('Bob Smith', 42)
    >>> sue = Person('Sue Jones', 45, 40000)
    
    >>> people = [bob, sue] # a "database" list
    >>> for person in people:
    print(person.name, person.pay)

    >>> x = [(person.name, person.pay) for person in people]
    >>> x
    [('Bob Smith', 0), ('Sue Jones', 40000)]

    >>> [rec.name for rec in people if rec.age >= 45] # SQL-ish query
    ['Sue Jones']
    >>> [(rec.age ** 2 if rec.age >= 45 else rec.age) for rec in people]
    [42, 2025]
