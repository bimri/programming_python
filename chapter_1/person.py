"Step 3: Stepping Up to OOP"
'Using Classes'
'Adding Behavior'
'''
By wrapping up bits of behavior in class method functions,
we can insulate clients from changes. And by packaging methods in classes along with
data, we provide a natural place for readers to look for code. In a sense, classes combine
records and the programs that process those records; methods provide logic that interprets
and updates the data (we say they are object-oriented, because they always
process an objectâ€™s data).
