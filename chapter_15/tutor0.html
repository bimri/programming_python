    HTML basics

    HTML is a descriptive markup language,
    based on tags— items enclosed in <> pairs. Some tags stand alone (e.g., <HR> specifies
    a horizontal rule). Others appear in begin/end pairs in which the end tag includes an
    extra slash.

    It’s important to keep in mind that HTML is used only to describe pages: your web
    browser reads it and translates its description to a web page with headers, paragraphs,
    links, and the like. Notably absent are both layout information—the browser is responsible
    for arranging components on the page—and syntax for programming logic—
    there are no if statements, loops, and so on. Raw HTML is strictly for defining pages, not for coding programs or
    specifying all user interface details. HTML’s lack of user interface control.

    HTML’s lack of user interface control and programmability is both a strength and a
    weakness. It’s well suited to describing pages and simple user interfaces at a high level.
    The browser, not you, handles physically laying out the page on your screen. On the
    other hand, HTML by itself does not directly support full-blown GUIs and requires us
    to introduce CGI scripts (or other technologies such as RIAs) to websites in order to
    add dynamic programmability to otherwise static HTML.

    Internet addresses (URLs)

    Once you write an HTML file, you need to put it somewhere a web browser can reference
    it. If you are using the locally running Python web server described earlier, this
    becomes trivial: use a URL of the form http://localhost/file.html to access web pages,
    and http://localhost/cgi-bin/file.py to name CGI scripts. This is implied by the fact that
    the web server script by default serves pages and scripts from the directory in which it
    is run.

    On other servers, URLs may be more complex. Like all HTML files, tutor0.html must
    be stored in a directory on the server machine, from which the resident web server
    program allows browsers to fetch pages.
