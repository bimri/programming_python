"""
Splitting on whitespace extracts the columns, and float converts to numbers,
but a fixed-size list wonâ€™t easily accommodate a set of sums (at least, not without extra
code to manage its size). Dictionaries are more convenient here because we can use
column positions as keys instead of using absolute offsets.
