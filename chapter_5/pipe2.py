"""
This version has also been augmented to close the unused end of the pipe in each process
(e.g., after the fork, the parent process closes its copy of the output side of the pipe
written by the child); programs should close unused pipe ends in general.
"""

'''
Notice that this versionâ€™s reads also return a text data str object now, per the default
r text mode for os.fdopen. As mentioned, pipes normally deal in binary byte strings
when their descriptors are used directly with os file tools, but wrapping in text-mode
files allows us to use str strings to represent text data instead of bytes. In this example,
bytes are decoded to str when read by the parent; using os.fdopen and text mode in
the child would allow us to avoid its manual encoding call, but the file object would
encode the str data anyhow (though the encoding is trivial for ASCII bytes like those
used here). As for simple files, the best mode for processing pipe data in is determined
by its nature.
