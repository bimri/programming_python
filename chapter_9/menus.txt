Menus

Menus are the pull-down lists you’re accustomed to seeing at the top of a window.
The options within a menu might trigger actions, much like clicking on a button; they may
also open other “cascading” submenus that list more options, pop up dialog windows,
and so on.

In tkinter, there are two kinds of menus you can add to your scripts: toplevel
window menus and frame-based menus. The former option is better suited to
whole windows, but the latter also works as a nested component.

This scheme is based on building trees of Menu wi dget obj ects. Si mpl y ass oci at e one t oplevel
Menu with the window, add other pull-down Menu objects as cascades of the toplevel
Menu, and add entries to each of the pull-down objects. Menus are cross-linked with
the next higher level, by using parent widget arguments and the Menu widget’s
add_cascade method. It works like this:
    1. Create a topmost Menu as the child of the window widget and configure the window’s
    menu attribute to be the new Menu.

    2. For each pull-down object, make a new Menu as the child of the topmost Menu and
    add the child as a cascade of the topmost Menu using add_cascade.
    
    3. Add menu selections to each pull-down Menu fr o m st e p 2, usi ng t he command opti ons
    of add_command to register selection callback handlers.
    
    4. Add a cascading submenu by making a new Menu as t he c hil d of t he Menu t he cascade
    extends and using add_cascade to link the parent to the child.
